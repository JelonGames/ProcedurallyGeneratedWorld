## 📌 Project Description
This project is scientific in nature and was created to better understand the mechanisms of procedural level generation. It was developed in parallel with engineering work, providing a practical complement to academic research.
<br>
The level generation mechanism draws inspiration from the system used in the Zero Sievert game, but in a simplified form. The goal was to create an efficient generation algorithm that could be easily analyzed and developed.
## ⚙️ Technologies
Game Engine: Unity 6000.0.31f1<br>
Algorithms used: Perlin noise, Flood Fill, BFS, DFS.<br>
Packages: Unity Tailmaps<br>
## 🔍 Main functionalities
✔ Procedural level generation inspired by Zero Sievert<br>
✔ Modular algorithm design for easy modification<br>
✔ Simple AI possible for expansion<br>
✔ Asynchronous scene loading<br>
