# 🏗️ Procedural Level Generation  

## 🎯 Project Goal  
This project was developed as part of research on **procedural level generation**, conducted alongside an engineering thesis. The main objective was to create a level generation system inspired by the mechanics of *Zero Sievert*, but in a much simpler form.  

The goal was not only to understand and implement procedural generation techniques but also to analyze their impact on gameplay and optimization possibilities. The project explores different approaches to level generation, considering both technical aspects and practical applications in game development.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Algorithms  
The project was built using **Unity 6000.0.31f1**, with the level generation process utilizing several key algorithms:  

- **Perlin Noise** – used to create naturally structured levels.  
- **Flood Fill (BFS)** – ensures that all parts of the level are accessible and prevents the creation of isolated areas.  
- **Asynchronous Level Loading** – optimizes performance by preventing freezes during level transitions.  

## 🧠 Key Features  
✔ **Procedural Level Generation** – ensures each playthrough features a unique map, making the game world dynamic and unpredictable.  
✔ **Level Consistency Validation** – using the BFS algorithm, the system prevents situations where players get stuck in isolated areas.  
✔ **Basic AI System** – enemies can navigate through generated levels, adding interactivity and dynamics to gameplay.  
✔ **Optimized Performance with Asynchronous Loading** – levels are generated in the background, reducing load times and improving overall game fluidity.

## 🌟 Summary  
This project combines **procedural generation, optimization, and basic AI** to create a functional and efficient level generation system. It serves as an analysis of different world-generation approaches, testing algorithms, and optimizing Unity’s performance.  

If you're interested in **procedural generation techniques, game optimization, or Unity development**, this project can be a great reference for your own experiments! 🚀
